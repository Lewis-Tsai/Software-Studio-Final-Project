<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an online web game.

* Players will be a soldier who serves in the special force, driving helicopters to maintain peace of the world around the world.
* The helicopter opened by the player can destroy the enemy by firing bullets, missiles as well as bombs.
* At the same time, the enemy will also fire the player with bullets, anti-tank missiles, the enemy-owned tanks can attack the helicopter as well, and the player will be deducted after being hit.
* If the player's blood bars are zero, the mission fails. Conversely, if the player can kill all the soldiers and destroy all the vehicles before the blood bars return to zero, and defeat all enemies, the mission is successful.
